A timer which monitors your PC activity and reminds you to take a break when you've been sitting down too long.

##Summary

You may have heard that [sitting down all day is killing you](http://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/heres-just-how-bad-sitting-around-you-n132471).  Perhaps you've heard that it's just as bad for your health as smoking.  Or maybe you've heard about that new research by Schmid and Leitzmann that finds a statistically significant link between sedentary lifestyles and increased cancer risk.  It's been said that exercise alone doesn't mitigate these risks -- only standing up and sitting less will do.  However, studies have also shown that people who take frequent breaks to perform other standing activities are at much lower risk for some of the dangers of sitting all day.

TakeBreak lets you set a reminder for yourself to take a break when you've been at your desk for too long.  It's made for "set it and forget it" functionality -- By default, every 60 minutes, it goes into "Break" mode and plays an audible noise.  The tray icon for the timer turns red and informs you that it's time to stand up.  You can tell the application that you will be standing up for the duration, or you can simply get up and walk away.  TakeBreak monitors your inactivity and resets the timer so that you're only reminded to take a break after a set amount of activity time, and never too soon after you've been away from your desk for a while.

Originally, TakeBreak was meant to be designed as a "Reverse Screensaver" application.  There are some pretty deep system hooks that will need to be investigated before this feature can be integrated.  I hope to add this functionality eventually, to add an extra level of break taking for those of us who would ignore the gentle reminder.  Please enjoy the application.
